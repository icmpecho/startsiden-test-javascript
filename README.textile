h1. Testing javascript in webpages

So, the problem we are always facing.. How do we test javascript? and user
interface javascript at that?

This attempt at a solution uses Rhino to load webpages, and execute any javascript
in there, giving you a DOM to work with and check, triggering events on etc.

h2. Give me the gist of it

Well, we provide a simple perl-function to run a javascript file
against a content-string. That way, so long as you can get the content in a perl
scalar, you can run javascript against it. You can for instance use
Catalyst::Test, or Test::WWWW::Mechanize::Catalyst to do that, without needing to
fork a server etc.

h2. How do I test it?

Well, you need rhino set up. You also need an executable script somewhere in your
PATH called rhino. Mine looks like this:

bc. #!/bin/bash
java -cp ~/Projects/js/rhino/js.jar org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main -opt -1 $@

Once that is in place, you should be able to run prove in the normal way.

bc. prove t/

If all goes well, you should see the regular test output!
